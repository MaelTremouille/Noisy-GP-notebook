## Internship at ONERA, Toulouse â€“ AI Department  

After a 2-month internship at ONERA, Toulouse, in the AI department, I had the opportunity to contribute to a notebook about Noisy Gaussian Processes.  

The goal of my internship was to implement a formula to re-interpolate the variance in the case of the Expected Improvement (EI) criterion while computing Bayesian Optimization.  

For further details about my work, you can check the following notebook:
